# HeatingControl
Small heating control program

This little program is created to act like a thermostat. In the current state it can control the house heating, and the boiler heating from different sources.
Heaters, pumps can be controlled through GPIOs.
Temperature sensors are the DS18B20-s. You can use wired sensors, and wireless ones. Wireless sensors use MQTT protocoll (and also the Android app). 
For monitoring and changing settings you have two options:  the Linux terminal and the HeatingControl Android app ( maybe the latest version has not been uploaded yet )

<b>Not using it anymore - 2022.07.12. I am currently working on a new version of it, that I am rewriting the whole code (no official WiringPi anymore :(, and other Linux things).</b>
